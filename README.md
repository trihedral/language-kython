# Kython language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and folding to Kython files in Atom.
Currntly using old-stye textmate regex syntax.  A tree-sitter
parser has been created, but the implementation descibed in
the atom flight manual has thus far failed to work with it.

Based on python language: https://github.com/atom/language-python
